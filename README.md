# Confession Page to Discord Webhook


## ETHICS

Please be aware that this program's purpose is to inform people about the potential outcomes of engaging with "confession pages." I want to clarify that I am not accountable for any misuse of this program.


## Introduction

The **Confession Page to Discord Webhook** is a simple HTML page that allows users to anonymously send confessions to a Discord server using a Discord webhook. This project is designed for online communities, forums, or websites where users can submit their confessions privately, and these confessions are then posted to a specific Discord channel for others to see.

## How It Works

This project consists of a single HTML file that you can host on any web server. Users can access this HTML page through their web browsers. When a user submits a confession, the confession is sent to a Discord server using a Discord webhook, ensuring the anonymity of the confessor.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you'll need the following:

1. **A Discord Account**: You need to have a Discord account to set up a webhook and receive confessions on your Discord server.

2. **A Web Hosting Server**: You should have access to a web hosting server where you can upload the HTML file. This can be a personal website, a hosting service, or any other web server you have access to.

## Installation and Configuration

Follow these steps to set up the Confession Page:

1. **Create a Discord Webhook**:

   - Go to your Discord server settings.
   - Click on "Integrations" or "Webhooks," depending on your Discord version.
   - Create a new webhook for the channel where you want to receive confessions.
   - Copy the webhook URL generated for your new webhook.

2. **Edit the HTML File**:

   - Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

   - Replace the placeholder value in the JavaScript section with your Discord webhook URL. 
   
3. **Upload the HTML File**:

   - Upload the modified `index.html` file to your web hosting server.

4. **Access the Confession Page**:

   - Share the URL of the hosted `index.html` file with your community members.


## Usage

- Users can visit the hosted HTML page and submit their confessions.

- When a user submits a confession, it will be sent to the specified Discord channel using the webhook.

- You can monitor the confessions in your Discord channel with the identity of the confessors.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the HTML page to match your community's style and preferences. You can modify the HTML structure, add CSS for styling, or enhance the JavaScript functionality as needed.
